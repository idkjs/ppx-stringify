# Using `ppx_42`: BuckleScript example

You can see an example of usage in a BuckleScript project in this folder.
The most relevant point is the `ppx-flags` in `bsconfig.json`, that is pointing to the ppx executable:

```
  "ppx-flags": [
    "esy x ppx_42"
  ],
```

To install and build the ppx binary so it is available to bsb (BuckleScript
build tool) in the the example app:

```bash
$ esy
```

Then you can run:

```bash
$ yarn build
```

or

```bash
$ npm build
```

At that point, you should see the file `src/Index.bs.js` with the following output:

```javascript
// Generated by BUCKLESCRIPT VERSION 4.0.7, PLEASE EDIT WITH CARE
'use strict';


var fourtyTwo = String(42);

console.log(fourtyTwo);

exports.fourtyTwo = fourtyTwo;
/* fourtyTwo Not a pure module */
```
